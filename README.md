Merlins Rez Helper
==================

This is an Addon to help you find dead group members as fast as possible to rez them back into the fight. 


If a member is fallen, an arrow will show you the way to the closest dead party member. 
If no one is dead, no arrow will be shown. 

There are several options of arrow layouts and options to change the opacity and size of the arrow(s). 

This addon is a fork of the "Exterminatus Group Leader" [V1](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info329-ExterminatusGroupLeader.html) [V2](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info922-ExterminatusGroupLeader.html)

If you have any problems or wishes you can write me an IG Messange (@Just_Merlin) or leave me a comment on the download page.
